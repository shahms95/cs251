0. Set your directory to be the directory containing the downloaded
Box2D package, and immediately make a copy of the archive that you
downloaded. Use the command 'cp -a' and understand what the "-a"
option does.

1. Extract the archive and change your directory to cs251_base_code.

2. You now want to install Box2D. Therefore, push your current
   directory on the stack by executing '% pushd ./external/src'

3. Take a moment to study what you have downloaded.  Different people
   take different times for it, but try to understand the structure of
   what you have got. Make sure that you read any *.txt files
   available in the download.  Do not try to understand the code at
   this point, but simply understand what has been provided.

4. You should have found a text file called cs251_README.txt.  Follow
   the instructions very carefully (but keep this text file window
   open).

5. If, and only if, you have successfully passed the check steps in
   (7) and (8) of that file, do the following.  If you are
   unsuccessful, do not proceed and ask for help.

6. 'pop' the directory stack using '% popd ' You should be back to
    where you were in step 1.

7. Now you want to get the picture shown in the tutorial conducted
   earlier. Therefore compile the program, using "% make"

8. Check the ./bin directory for the existence of "cs251_base"
   executable.

9. Run the program.

Repeat the whole process 2 more times.  Each of the persons in the
group should do it, and the others should observe what's going on.
